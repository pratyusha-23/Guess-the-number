# Guess-the-number

## Description

"Guess the Number" is a simple and fun game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number. With each incorrect guess, the player's score decreases. The game keeps track of the player's highest score.

## How It Works

1. The game generates a random number.
2. The player makes guesses until the correct number is guessed.
3. With each incorrect guess, the score decreases.
4. When the player guesses the correct number, the game ends, and the final score is displayed.
5. The game stores the highest score achieved across all sessions.
